        <h3> Dabl, a video-based dating app startup</h3>
        <hr style="border: none;">
        <h4> Context</h4>
        <h5> Background History of Dabl: it's a video-based dating app founded by two U-M alumni and their friend. Their
          belief statement is "Meet People Not Profiles". Their app idea is to share a video each day, like cool videos
          you see, match to see something new about the people you like everyday. A refreshing way for real people to
          date, one moment at a time. </h5>
        <h5> Problem: The app was originally created to help people meet each other throughout the campus. The creators
          of the team wanted to revamp the app transforming it into an app that combines features from both BeReal and
          Tiktok that allows people to sense each other's personalities when meeting others. </h5>
        <h5> Solution: We worked with the creators to redesign the user interface using Figma, develop survey
          questions,generate prompt ideas. We also researched our competitors, conducted market analysis, and developed
          belief statements.</h5>

          purpose is to reduce financial barriers of art by providing free art classes at local schools and BBBS Metro
          Detroit. </h5>
        <h5> Problem: Many people have not heard of Artdillo and there are a few competitors in the area. We needed to
          define the competitive advantage of Artdillo while targeting young college students from ages 18 to 25 year
          olds. </h5>
        <h5> Solution: At the end of the semester we came up with 3 deliverables. The first being a tote bag painting
          event in order to attract students to learn about Artdillo by using their stored art supplies to paint a tote
          bag and contacting the President to further boost and advertise the event. </h5>

          Farmers' Market, Kerrytown Concert House, Braun Court, the Sunday Artisan Market, antique stores, and more.
        </h5>
        <h5> Problem: We noticed that they wanted to revamp their website in order to attract customers and wanted to
          make more college students visit Kerrytown Marketplace more often. </h5>
        <h5> Solution: We worked with our creative design team to meet weekly to work on the user interface using Figma

          a new location. They also had many products on their menus and were having trouble marketing their new drinks.
        </h5>
        <h5> Solution: We came up with a march madness for bubble tea and set up shop at Mason Hall which is a popular
          location for students. We were able to increase brand awareness and also get feedback and answer survey
          question in doing so. </h5>

          declining due to increased competition and a lack of differentiation from other air fresheners in the market.
          </h6>
          <h5> Solution: We came up with a few solutions to target these pet owners using social media platforms.
            Introduce new innovative scent delivery systems, such as a Febreze plug-in device with adjustable scent
            intensity, to create a unique selling proposition and increase market share.

          app. We created designs of the user interface using Figma and looked at the documentation for the UI Sticker
          Extension Kit. Using the knowledge of the market research we implemeneted the information. </h5>
